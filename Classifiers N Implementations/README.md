## The project:
* This work aims at learning techniques for classification of object images into 10 classes ( bird, plane, frog, horse etc )
* See implementations of KNN, SVM, Softmax, 2 layer nets and classification with features.
* Go in detail of working with loops and then vectorized methods to accelerate computation utilizing parellelism in machines.

## Working Implementations folder:
* Find complete folder with dependencies included.
* I also created a fun implementation where I used momentum optimizer for x% of epochs and Gradient Descent for 100 - x% of epochs then later performed hyper parameter tuning of this x to get best optimization within 1500 epochs. (Check Bonus.ipynb)
