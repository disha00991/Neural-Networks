* This folder contains working implementations for classification of object images into 10 classes ( bird, plane, frog, horse etc ) 
* Uses KNN, SVM, Softmax, 2 layer nets and classification with features. Works best when ported to Google Colaboratory!
* I also created a Bonus implementation where I used momentum optimizer for x% of epochs and Gradient Descent for 100 - x% of epochs then later performed hyper parameter tuning of this x to get best optimization within 1500 epochs.
